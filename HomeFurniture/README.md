# Lab — Home Furniture sharing

> Objective: The objective of this lab is to use system view controllers in an app that lists rooms and furniture and allows users to share furniture items with other apps on their device.
>
> Make sure to build and run your app on a physical iOS device if you have one—rather than on Simulator—so you'll have more apps that permit image and text sharing.
>
> Your app has been started for you. Open the project called “HomeFurniture” in your student resources folder. Take a few minutes to get familiar with the project. Run the app and navigate to the detail screen of a furniture item. Notice that the button in the middle of the screen says “Choose Photo,” but that it doesn't do anything when you tap it. The button at the bottom left also does nothing. Your task in this lab is to add functionality to these two buttons.
