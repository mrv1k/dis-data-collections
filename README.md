> # Lab — Favorite Books
>
> Objective: The objective of this lab is to implement intermediate table view features into an app that keeps track of your favorite books.
>
> You'll find a starter project called “FavoriteBooks” in your student resources folder. Take a minute to look it over and run it to see how it behaves. You'll notice that it contains a table view controller that segues to a regular view controller. The regular view controller contains a form that allows the user to enter details about a book. In this lab, you'll replace the form with a static table view, add the capability to delete books from the main list of books, and create a custom table view cell to better display the details of each book in the main list.
